We recommend training a byte-level BPE (rather than let’s say, a WordPiece tokenizer like BERT) because it will start building its vocabulary from an alphabet of single bytes, so all words will be decomposable into tokens (no more <unk> tokens!).
As the model is BERT-like, we’ll train it on a task of Masked language modeling, i.e. the predict how to fill arbitrary tokens that we randomly mask in the dataset. This is taken care of by the example script.
